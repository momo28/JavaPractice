## Practice Problems Questions

Java code practice problems from possible interview questions.

1. Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique chars. What if you can not use additional data structures?
2. (Check C++ Practice Project)
3. Given 2 strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.
4. Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. Use a Java character array.
5. Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters.  For example, the 
string 'aabcccccaaa' would become 'a2b1c5a3.  If the compressd string would bot become smaller than the original string,
your method should return the original string.  You can assume the string has only upper and lower case letters (a-z).
